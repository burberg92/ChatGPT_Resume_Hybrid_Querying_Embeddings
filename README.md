# Resume_LLM

This Jupyter notebook accompanies the paper "Resume Parsing Model", which draws inspiration from the research principle "Textbooks are all You Need.". The paper focuses on leveraging utilizing embeddings, hybrid querying, and prompt engineering to enhance the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).  

# Contents

## Document Chunking:
- Explanation of the need for text chunking in LLMs.
- Implementation of the RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for efficient chunking.
- Demonstrations of how the document chunking process is applied to sample documents.

## Semantic Vectorization:
- Introduction to semantic vectorization and its importance in LLMs.
- Implementation of contextualized word embeddings using pre-trained models.
- Examples of generating semantic vectors for chunks of text.

## Chroma Vector Database:
- Implementation of database interaction using Python libraries.
- Illustrations of how vectorized data is stored, managed, and retrieved.

## Hybrid Querying:

- Introduction to the concept of hybrid querying for enhanced LLM interactions.
- Implementation of techniques for combining vectorized content with user queries.
- Examples of how hybrid querying improves the relevance and coherence of LLM responses.

## Optimized Model Output:

- Explanation of advanced prompt engineering techniques for enhancing LLM output.
- Implementation details of techniques such as Self-Refine and Chain-of-Thought.
- Examples showcasing how these techniques improve the coherence and quality of LLM-generated content.
